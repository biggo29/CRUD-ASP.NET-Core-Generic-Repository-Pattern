Code First Approach
-------------------
As this project was made with the DBFirst approach, I would needed to create a new DB and Tables to work this project perfectly. 
Then I thought CodeFirst Approach will come handy this time. The commands are written below. 
> To create a new migration, which will create a migration folder with migration name. 
add-migration initialmigration 
> If connection string OK then
update-database
